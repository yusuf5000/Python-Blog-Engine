The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite
amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.

In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. However, the
probability that monkeys filling the observable universe would type a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is
so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer
than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).

In this context, "almost surely" is a mathematical term with a precise meaning, and the "monkey" is not an actual
monkey, but a metaphor for an abstract device that produces an endless random sequence of letters and symbols.
